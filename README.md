# Daily Commit Streak Tracker

This is an automated GitHub Action that updates this repo every day to keep my commit streak alive and my GitHub profile active.

## Why this repo?
Consistency is key in building great habits as a developer. This repo helps me stay active daily on GitHub and reminds me to keep learning and building.

## How it works
- A GitHub Action runs every day at 12:00 UTC.
- It updates the `daily.md` file with the current date and time.
- That update is committed and pushed, contributing to my daily commit streak.
