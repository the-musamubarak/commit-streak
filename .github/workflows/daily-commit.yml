I notice a few issues with your GitHub Actions workflow for maintaining a daily commit streak. Here's a corrected version with explanations:

```yaml
name: Daily Commit Streak
on:
  schedule:
    - cron: '0 12 * * *'  # Every day at 12:00 UTC (fixed syntax)
  workflow_dispatch:

jobs:
  commit:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout Repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v3
        with:
          fetch-depth: 0  # Needed to properly commit later

      - name: Update daily.md file
        run: echo "Last commit: $(date -u)" >> daily.md

      - name: Commit changes
        run: |
          git config user.name "github-actions[bot]"
          git config user.email "41898282+github-actions[bot]@users.noreply.github.com"
          git add daily.md
          git diff --quiet && git diff --cached --quiet || git commit -m "Daily commit for streak [skip ci]"
          git push
        env:
          GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
```

Key fixes and improvements:
1. Fixed the cron syntax - you had `**` instead of `* *` for day-of-week
2. Added `fetch-depth: 0` to the checkout step to ensure proper git history
3. Used `date -u` to ensure UTC time format
4. Improved the commit logic to only commit if there are changes (better than using `|| echo`)
5. The `[skip ci]` in the commit message will prevent recursive workflow runs

Note: GitHub's contribution graph may not count these automated commits toward your streak, as they can detect and filter out bot-generated commits. For a genuine streak, manual commits are more reliable.

Also, make sure the `daily.md` file exists in your repository before this workflow runs for the first time.
